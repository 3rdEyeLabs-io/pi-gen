IMG_NAME=
# (Default: unset)
# The name of the image to build with the current stage directories.
# Setting IMG_NAME=Raspbian is logical for an unmodified RPi-Distro/pi-gen build,
# but you should use something else for a customized version.
# Export files in stages may add suffixes to IMG_NAME.

USE_QCOW2=
# EXPERIMENTAL (Default: 0 )
#    Instead of using traditional way of building the rootfs of every stage in single subdirectories and copying over the previous one to the next one, qcow2 based virtual # disks with backing images are used in every stage.
# This speeds up the build process and reduces overall space consumption significantly.
#    Additional optional parameters regarding qcow2 build:
#        BASE_QCOW2_SIZE (Default: 12G)
#        Size of the virtual qcow2 disk.
#	Note: it will not actually use that much of space at once but defines the maximum size of the virtual disk.
#	If you change the build process by adding a lot of bigger packages or additional build stages, it can be necessary to increase the value because the virtual disk can 
#   run out of space like a normal hard drive would.
#   CAUTION: Although the qcow2 build mechanism will run fine inside Docker, it can happen that the network block device is not disconnected correctly after the Docker
#   process has ended abnormally.
#   In that case see Disconnect an image if something went wrong
    
RELEASE=
# (Default: bullseye)
# The release version to build images against.
# Valid values are any supported Debian release.
# However, since different releases will have different sets of packages available, you'll need to either modify your stages accordingly, or checkout the appropriate
# branch.
# For example, if you'd like to build a buster image, you should do so from the buster branch.

APT_PROXY=
# (Default: unset)
# If you require the use of an apt proxy, set it here. This proxy setting will not be included in the image, making it safe to use an apt-cacher or similar package for development.

BASE_DIR=
# (Default: location of build.sh)
#    CAUTION: Currently, changing this value will probably break build.sh
#    Top-level directory for pi-gen. Contains stage directories, build scripts, and by default both work and deployment directories.

WORK_DIR=
# (Default: "$BASE_DIR/work")
#    Directory in which pi-gen builds the target system. This value can be changed if you have a suitably large, fast storage location for stages to be built and cached.
#    Note, WORK_DIR stores a complete copy of the target system for each build stage, amounting to tens of gigabytes in the case of Raspbian.
#    CAUTION: If your working directory is on an NTFS partition you probably won't be able to build: make sure this is a proper Linux filesystem.

DEPLOY_DIR=
# (Default: "$BASE_DIR/deploy")
#    Output directory for target system images and NOOBS bundles.

DEPLOY_COMPRESSION=
# (Default: zip)
#    Set to:
#        none to deploy the actual image (.img).
#        zip to deploy a zipped image (.zip).
#        gz to deploy a gzipped image (.img.gz).
#        xz to deploy a xzipped image (.img.xz).
#    DEPLOY_ZIP (Deprecated)
#    This option has been deprecated in favor of DEPLOY_COMPRESSION.
#    If DEPLOY_ZIP=0 is still present in your config file, the behavior is the same as with DEPLOY_COMPRESSION=none.

COMPRESSION_LEVEL=
# (Default: 6)
#    Compression level to be used when using zip, gz or xz for DEPLOY_COMPRESSION. From 0 to 9 (refer to the tool man page for more information on this. Usually 0 is no
#    compression but very fast, up to 9 with the best compression but very slow ).

USE_QEMU
# (Default: "0")
#    Setting to '1' enables the QEMU mode - creating an image that can be mounted via QEMU for an emulated environment.
#    These images include "-qemu" in the image file name.

LOCALE_DEFAULT=
# (Default: "en_GB.UTF-8" )
#    Default system locale.

TARGET_HOSTNAME=
# (Default: "raspberrypi" )
#    Setting the hostname to the specified value.

KEYBOARD_KEYMAP=
# (Default: "gb" )
#    Default keyboard keymap.
#    To get the current value from a running system, run debconf-show keyboard-configuration and look at the keyboard-configuration/xkb-keymap value.

KEYBOARD_LAYOUT=
# (Default: "English (UK)" )
#    Default keyboard layout.
#    To get the current value from a running system, run debconf-show keyboard-configuration and look at the keyboard-configuration/variant value.

TIMEZONE_DEFAULT=
# (Default: "Europe/London" )
#    To get the current value from a running system, look in /etc/timezone.

FIRST_USER_NAME=
# (Default: pi)
#    Username for the first user. This user only exists during the image creation process.
#    Unless DISABLE_FIRST_BOOT_USER_RENAME is set to 1, this user will be renamed on the first boot with a name chosen by the final user.
#    This security feature is designed to prevent shipping images with a default username and help prevent malicious actors from taking over your devices.

FIRST_USER_PASS=
# (Default: unset)
#    Password for the first user. If unset, the account is locked.

DISABLE_FIRST_BOOT_USER_RENAME=
# (Default: 0)
#    Disable the renaming of the first user during the first boot. This make it so FIRST_USER_NAME stays activated.
#    FIRST_USER_PASS must be set for this to work.
#    Please be aware of the implied security risk of defining a default username and password for your devices.

WPA_ESSID=
WPA_PASSWORD=
WPA_COUNTRY=
# (Default: unset)
#    If these are set, they are use to configure wpa_supplicant.conf, so that the Raspberry Pi can automatically connect to a wireless network on first boot.
#    If WPA_ESSID is set and WPA_PASSWORD is unset an unprotected wireless network will be configured.
#    If set, WPA_PASSWORD must be between 8 and 63 characters. WPA_COUNTRY is a 2-letter ISO/IEC 3166 country Code, i.e. GB

ENABLE_SSH=
# (Default: 0)
#    Setting to 1 will enable ssh server for remote log in.
#    Note that if you are using a common password such as the defaults there is a high risk of attackers taking over you Raspberry Pi.

PUBKEY_SSH_FIRST_USER=
# (Default: unset)
#    Setting this to a value will make that value the contents of the FIRST_USER_NAME's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.
#    Obviously the value should therefore be a valid authorized_keys file. Note that this does not automatically enable SSH.

PUBKEY_ONLY_SSH=
# (Default: 0)
#    Setting to 1 will disable password authentication for SSH and enable public key authentication.
#    Note that if SSH is not enabled this will take effect when SSH becomes enabled.

SETFCAP=
# (Default: unset)
#        Setting to 1 will prevent pi-gen from dropping the "capabilities" feature.
#        Generating the root filesystem with capabilities enabled and running it from a filesystem that does not support capabilities (like NFS) can cause issues.
#        Only enable this if you understand what it is.

STAGE_LIST=
# (Default: stage*)
#    If set, then instead of working through the numeric stages in order, this list will be followed.
#    For example setting to "stage0 stage1 mystage stage2" will run the contents of mystage before stage2.
#    Note that quotes are needed around the list. An absolute or relative path can be given for stages outside the pi-gen directory.

# A simple example for building Raspbian:

#      IMG_NAME='Raspbian'

# The config file can also be specified on the command line as an argument the build.sh or build-docker.sh scripts.

#       ./build.sh -c myconfig

# This is parsed after config so can be used to override values set there.
